to debug errors and explore the assignment/test cases.

Prompts/Commands Used:

Here is my code: from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def index(): return 'Hello, world!' # Run the application (optional, for running directly) if __name__ == "__main__": app.run()
- I keep getting the flask not imported error even though I pip installed it already and it runs when I click the link
- (Attached assignment) What would code look like in python? Don't give me the whole answer I just want to know how it starts
- (Attached code) What test cases code be done for my code
